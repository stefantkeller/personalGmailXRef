# Personal gmail cross-reference (pgxref)

Email threads on gmail have the url ...

Sometimes it is handy to keep track of this cryptic handle in personal notes. 
For example, such a message could be "Budget is $xxx, see discussion at AsdF4yuiP." 
To find the email thread all I have to do is copy the identifyer onto the gmail url.

As such this is almost identical to the DOI-search extension: 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/doi-search/?src=userprofile  

For the development of this pgxref extension I followed the instructions at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions


This pgxref extension you can find at
