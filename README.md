# Personal gmail cross-reference (pgxref)

Email threads on gmail have the url https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?#all/And-a-cryptic-handle  

Sometimes it is handy to keep track of this cryptic handle in personal notes. 
For example, such a message could be "Budget is $xxx, see discussion at AsdF4yuiP." 
To find the email thread all I have to do is copy the identifyer onto the gmail url.
